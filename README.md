## 🚀 **About Me**

I am an RF System Design & Test Engineer specializing in **antenna design**, **RF front‑end integration**, **automated test systems**, and **aerospace communication technologies**. My work spans **Ka/Ku‑band antenna development**, **beamforming networks**, **RF validation**, and **ATE automation** using MATLAB, Python, C/C++, and industry‑standard simulation tools.

I enjoy solving complex RF challenges, optimizing system performance, and building robust automated test workflows that scale.
