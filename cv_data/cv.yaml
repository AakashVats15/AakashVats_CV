summary:
  - paragraph: >
      Quantitative researcher with a strong foundation in stochastic processes,
      numerical optimisation, and statistical signal analysis, transitioning into
      systematic modelling and derivatives research. Experienced in building Monte
      Carlo engines, volatility-forecasting models (ARIMA/GARCH), machine-learning
      pipelines for time-series forecasting and risk modelling, and risk-neutral
      pricing frameworks in Python.
